# Layton — A Lightweight ML-Based NIDS for TCP/IP Flow Classification

Today I present you Layton, my bachelor's thesis (in progress). It's a **novel**
 machine learning-powered **Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)** designed for real-time **flow-level TCP/IP traffic classification**.

Written in C as a multithreaded application, Layton captures packets using libpcap, extracts flow features mimicking **CIC-FlowMeter**, and uses a trained **XGBoost model** (exported to ONNX) to classify flows as **benign or malicious** in real time — all in one lightweight pipeline. (Model nor data included).

## Key Features

- Real-time packet sniffing (TCP/IP)
- Multithreaded architecture for optimal performance
- Flow extraction & feature engineering (CIC-FlowMeter-style)
- XGBoost-based binary classification (benign / malicious)

---

## How It Works

1. **Sniffing** — Captures live packets from the interface specified in the `config.json` file using libpcap. 
2. **Flow Aggregation** — Groups packets into bidirectional flows, storing them in a HashMap where their features are updated while the flows are alive.
3. **Feature Extraction** — Computes statistical features per flow (duration, packet size, flags, etc.).
4. **Classification** — When flows are finished (a TCP closing sequence is registered or the flow expired) classification is done by ONNX. Features given to inference are the ones the model expect (from the training phase).
5. **Output** — Labels each flow as benign or malicious.

## Build Requirements
- CMake 3.28.3+
- GCC with C11 support
- POSIX-compliant system (Linux/Unix)
---

## Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <https://github.com/alonsoveliz1/NIDS>
cd layton
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libpcap-dev libjson-c-dev cmake build-essential pkg-config

# For development/testing
sudo apt-get install libcriterion-dev

# For ONNX Runtime, download from official releases, version used in the project is 1.21.1

```
### 3. Configuration
Edit `config.json` to specify your network interface and the rest of parameters:
```json
{
  "interface": "enp4s0",
  "bufsize": 65535,
  "flow_table_init_size": 10000,
  "model_path": "../xgboost_model.onnx" 
}
```

### 4. Build the Project
```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake --build .
```

## Usage

### Basic Execution
```bash
# Run with default configuration
sudo bin/nids_backend 

# Run with custom config
.bin/nids_backend 
--config /path/to/config.json    
--interface interface_name_for_pcap
--model /custom/path/to/model
--verbose verbose_logging_enabled
--help  show options
```

### Testing
```bash
# Run unit tests
./build/bin/nids_unit_tests
```


## Model & Dataset

Layton uses an **XGBoost binary classifier** trained on the **CIC-BCCC-TabularIoT-2024 dataset**, specifically designed for IoT network traffic analysis. The model achieves:

- **High accuracy** in distinguishing benign vs malicious flows (95% macro f1 score)
- **Low latency** inference suitable for real-time processing  
- **Compact size** when exported to ONNX format

*Note: The trained model and dataset are not included in this repository due to not owning the source data. The dataset can be obtained from the original publishers and the ML pipeline is included in [this repository](https://github.com/alonsoveliz1/NIDS-ML-MODELS).*
